# Baidshizhou-Rediscovered

This is a reposityry we created to hold students design files generated during the summer camp, Baishizhou Rediscovered. 
It's a camp we broght students into the biggest urban village in Shenzhen, Baishizhou, to do researches about it and then,
came back to lab and present their ideas abou the what's next for urban village with maker skills they can get in two days.

Should we take it down or help it evolve in a practical way? 

Teenagers make their own presentations. Some 2D design files and pictures are included here.
